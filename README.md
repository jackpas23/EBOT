BBOT firefox extension. 
Here.

If your firefox instance is installed via snap, your SOL as of now(not really but kind of if you don't want to lift a finger).

once installed, go to extensions in firefox, select top right cog, debug add-ons, load temporary add-on, select the manifest.json from the file list.
