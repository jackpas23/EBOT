# BBOT Firefox Plugin

### Overview

The Firefox BBOT extension is for bug bounty hunters and pentesters who want to trigger BBOT scans from the browser.

### Installation

Open Firefox.

Go to Extensions (about:addons).

Click the top-right cog.

Select "Debug Add-ons."

Click "Load Temporary Add-on."

Select manifest.json from the extension folder.

### Usage

Once loaded, the extension adds a button to trigger BBOT scans from the browser context. Right-click a link, choose "Scan with BBOT," and it runs the scan in your configured environment.

### Notes

This is a temporary load, so it needs to be reloaded each session.

Modify manifest.json as needed for persistent installs.

Developed for quick use during engagements. No guarantees, use at your own risk.
